# PyTorch implementation Dynamics-Aware Discovery of Skills (DADS).
The ``dads-torch`` repository contains all modules needed for the implementation of [DADS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01657).
In addition, all routines for off-policy training and zero-shot execution in MujoCo environments are supported.
